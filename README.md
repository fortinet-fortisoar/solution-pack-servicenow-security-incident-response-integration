# Overview

**ServiceNow Security Incident Response (SIR) integration** Solution pack helps users manage the life cycle of their security incidents from initial analysis to containment, eradication, and recovery. Security Incident Response enables you to get a comprehensive understanding of incident response procedures performed by your analysts, and understand trends and bottlenecks in those procedures with analytic-driven dashboards and reporting.

You can configure the ServiceNow connector included with this solution pack to ingest *Security Incidents* from ServiceNow and create a corresponding security incident in FortiSOAR.
